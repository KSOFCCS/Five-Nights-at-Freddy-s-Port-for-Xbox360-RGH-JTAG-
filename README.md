# Five-Nights-at-Freddy-s-Port-for-Xbox360-RGH-JTAG-
This project is dedicated to developing a native port of Five Nights at Freddy's for the Xbox 360 console, specifically focused on systems with RGH and JTAG modifications. The main objective is to provide a fluid and faithful experience to the original title, with fully mapped controls and performance optimization for the console's hardware. The work involves the technical adaptation of the files and code to ensure that the suspenseful atmosphere is preserved with stability, offering users a quality alternative to play this classic on the Xbox 360.
